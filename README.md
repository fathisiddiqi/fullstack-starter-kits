# ⚡ Fullstack Starter Kits

A collection of modern fullstack templates designed for **fast development**, **scalability**, and **offline-first** experiences.  
This repository currently includes:

- 📱 **expo-offline-app** — a React Native app powered by Expo, designed to work seamlessly offline.
- ☁️ **hono-cloudflare-workers** — a lightweight backend built with Hono and deployed on Cloudflare Workers.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
.
├── expo-offline-app/          # Mobile app (mobile)
└── hono-cloudflare-workers/   # Backend API (backend)
```

Each directory is an independent project but can later be connected or managed under a single monorepo setup.

## 🚀 Getting Started

#### 📱 Expo Offline App

The Expo app provides a base for creating offline-capable React Native applications with local caching, synchronization, and persistent storage.

```bash
npx degit fathisiddiqi/fullstack-starter-kits/expo-offline-app my-expo-app
```

---

#### ☁️ Hono Cloudflare Workers

The backend uses [Hono](https://hono.dev) — a small, fast web framework — deployed to Cloudflare Workers for serverless performance and scalability.

```bash
npx degit fathisiddiqi/fullstack-starter-kits/hono-cloudflare-workers my-hono-app
```
