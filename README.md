## Getting Started

#### Expo Offline App

The Expo app provides a base for creating offline-capable React Native applications with local caching, synchronization, and persistent storage.

```bash
npx degit fathisiddiqi/fullstack-starter-kits/expo-offline-app my-expo-app
```

#### Hono Cloudflare Workers

The backend uses [Hono](https://hono.dev) — a small, fast web framework — deployed to Cloudflare Workers for serverless performance and scalability.

```bash
npx degit fathisiddiqi/fullstack-starter-kits/hono-cloudflare-workers my-hono-app
```
